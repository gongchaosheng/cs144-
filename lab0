In this section ,when i trying to  run telnet cs144.keithw.org http on the vm,due to my low type speed,here displayed  "Connection closed by foreign host".
At first i think its my operation fault to cause such "error",after 2hours searching i realized that it is just because my low type speed.

2.3
I learned git push by studying 2.3.
the command i learned are listed in the follow:

  "git branch" //examine all local branch ,the green one is the present branch.
  "git checkout" xx //switch to xx branch
  "git checkout -b xx" // establish xx branch and switch to it
  "git merge xx" // merge xxbranch to present branch


Every time i finished my labx ,i should 
  "git add xxxfile"  //push xxx from local repo to the buffer 
  "git commit -m [xx注释]"  //push xxxfile to present branch
  "git push origin labx"  //push present branch to the github repo's branch labx
