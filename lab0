In this section ,when i trying to  run telnet cs144.keithw.org http on the vm,due to my low type speed,here displayed  "Connection closed by foreign host".
At first i think its my operation fault to cause such "error",after 2hours searching i realized that it is just because my low type speed.

okokokokok, solve this "small"fault and go to sleep

I learned git push by studying 2.3.
the command i learned are listed in the follow:

  "git branch" //examine all local branch ,the green one is the present branch.
  "git checkout" xx //switch to xx branch
  "git checkout -b xx" // establish xx branch and switch to it
  "git merge xx" // merge xxbranch to present branch
  "git remote -v" //show all the remote have been added
  "git remote add origin xxxx" let xxxx be your origin
  "git remote remove origin/upstream/xxxx" delete this remote  in local 


Every time i finished my labx ,i should 
  "git add xxxfile"  //push xxx from local repo to the buffer 
  "git commit -m [xx注释]"  //push xxxfile to present branch
  "git push origin labx"  //push present branch to the github repo's branch labx

The webget:
    
    socket is passway between client host to server host
    client host tells server the aim host and path by using socket.And in the same ,server tells the message to client by using socket.
    The code should be compiled in bulid directory by running 'make'
    
The structure of http request:
     GET path HTTP/1.1
     Host: hostname
     Connection: close
     
Byte stream:

    size_t is a data type like unsigned int,and it is usigned integer.
    I think i should use deque as the  stream's data structure.
